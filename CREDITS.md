This project, **FelineGuard**, integrates custom embedded systems software with open-source mechanical designs. We gratefully acknowledge the following contributions:

## Mechanical Design
The 3D-printed mechanical structure of the feeder is based on the **"Pet Feeder"** designed by **szuchid**.

* **Why this design:** We chose this design for its robust auger mechanism, compatibility with standard Nema 17 stepper motors, and its clever use of standard soda bottles as a hopper, which simplifies the assembly process.

## Hardware Components
* **Stepper Motor:** Nema 17 (STEPPERONLINE)
* **Driver:** A4988 Stepper Motor Driver Module
* **MCU:** STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-F446RE (STM32) & ESP32-S3 Feather
* **Sensors:** HX711 Load Cell Amplifier & IR Break Beam Sensors
